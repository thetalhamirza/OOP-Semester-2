# OOP Lab 1

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the first Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lab tasks. Each task focuses on fundamental C++ concepts such as input/output, loops, functions, and basic class structures.

## Files

| File   | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `Q1.cpp` | Implemented parameters in the main function thus can be passed during execution (argv). Array length and data are the parameters. |
| `Q2.cpp` | Implemented parameters in the main function thus can be passed during execution (argv). Array data is passed as parameters in the char pointer array, and then summed. |
| `Q3.cpp` | Good ol' conditional statements. %.2f was used to fix 2 decimal places. |
| `Q4.cpp` | Convert weight from kgs to pounds. Basic input/output operations. |
| `Q5.cpp` | Basic calculations and printing of data. |
| `Q6.cpp` | Implementing an equivalent to python's strip() function using loops. |

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/thetalhamirza/OOP-Lab-1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the repository folder:
   ```sh
   cd OOP-Lab-1
   ```
3. Compile any C++ file using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):
   ```sh
   g++ Q1.cpp -o Q1
   ```
4. Run the compiled executable:
   ```sh
   ./Q1
   ```

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic understanding of C++ programming
